# android_vending_machine

This is an extention of a project I originally made in Javascript ( https://shrouded-sea-71864.herokuapp.com ). In this project the original vending functionality has been coupled with task/habit tracking functionality to behave as a reward mechanism , i.e. finish a task and your rewarded with a picture of a cute cat.
